Previous project used python and flask and I decided to start over. Using html and css so far.


Using createaclickablemap.com for the map. I will need to recreate it later when I have a paid for domain. I attempted to get the links working using free hosting with github pages but this didn't work.

Starting with the main map page, a wip page and branching out from there. There should be a way to make journal entries, with or without a location on the map. I'd like to have users be able to place pins on the map in the future. That could be just for their journal or a suggestion to add to the map of possible locations. A journal entry needs to accept text as well as photos. There should be a login page that works (looking into using php for this). A log out button. I believe the way we had it before was, after clicking on a state it would bring up a google map of that state with the different locations as pins with a name and description to the side of the map. Currently the links do not work.

Once I've got more functionality I'll buy a domain and hosting from hostinger.
