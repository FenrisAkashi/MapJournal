Previous project used python and flask and I decided to start over and keep it to html, css and javascript if possible.


Using createaclickablemap.com for the map. I will need to recreate it later when I have a paid for domain. I will try to set it up using github pages for now.

Starting with the main map page and a wip page and branching out from there. There should be a way to make journal entries, with or without a location on the map. I'd like to be able to place pins on the map in the future. A journal entry needs to accept text as well as photos. There should be a login page that works. A log out button. I believe the way we had it before was, after clicking on a state it would bring up a google map of that state with the different locations as pins with a name and description to the side of the map. Currently the links do not work.

Next step: set up github pages to host for free, then make clickable links for the states and check if that will work for now.
